# ParticleLevelDarkJet
This repository contains four folders:

- [Example models](https://github.com/DarkJets-hep/ParticleLevelDarkJet/tree/main/Example%20models) contains Pythia cards for the models with a dijet topology studied in this thesis (Models A-E and SVJ).
- [Headers](https://github.com/DarkJets-hep/ParticleLevelDarkJet/tree/main/Headers) contains C++ header files with functions that are meant to be reusable in other projects. These functions are header-only, so you can use them simply by including the correct header.
- [Rivet](https://github.com/DarkJets-hep/ParticleLevelDarkJet/tree/main/Rivet) contains the Rivet code used to run the analyses for this thesis.
- [Root](https://github.com/DarkJets-hep/ParticleLevelDarkJet/tree/main/Root) contains the ROOT code used to produce plots from the .root files produced from the ATLAS code. The ATLAS code itself is available [in this private repository](https://github.com/DarkJets-hep/Atlas-DarkJetStudies).
